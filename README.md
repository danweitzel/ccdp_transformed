# Comparative Campaign Dynamics Project Data Transformation

The [Comparative Campaign Dynamics Project](https://www.mzes.uni-mannheim.de/d7/en/datasets/comparative-campaign-dynamics-dataset) offers an amazing data set about the statements political parties make about themselves (subject statements) and other parties (other statements) during election campaigns (Classified as the one month period before an election except for Portugal where it is the two weeks period). The data set includes campaign statements by parties in two elections each in ten European countries. 

**If you use the data set please use the following data citation:**

Debus, Marc, Zeynep Somer-Topcu, and Margit Tavits. 2018. Comparative Campaign Dynamics Dataset. Mannheim: Mannheim Centre for European Social Research, University of Mannheim.

The data sets in this repository provide the following data about party statements:
1. Issue position statements by parties about themselves and other parties.
2. Issue direction statements by parties about themselves and other parties.
3. Issue valence statements by parties about themselves and other parties.
4. Valence statements by parties about themselves and other parties.

In this respository I provide the code to transform the raw CCDP data set to a data set ready for analysis by social scientists.
