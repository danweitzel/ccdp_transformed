# Comparative Campaign Dynamics Project Data Transformation

The [Comparative Campaign Dynamics Project](https://www.mzes.uni-mannheim.de/d7/en/datasets/comparative-campaign-dynamics-dataset) offers an amazing data set about the statements political parties make about themselves (subject statements) and other parties (other statements) during election campaigns. The data set includes campaign statements by parties in two elections each in ten European countries. 

In this respository I provide the code to transform the raw CCDP data set to a data set ready for analysis by social scientists.
